        "url": "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/study-backs-googles-claims-ai-search-boosts-user-satisfaction/523059/",
        "content": "A new study finds that despite concerns about AI in online services, users are more satisfied with search engines and social media platforms than before.\n\nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) conducted its annual survey of search and social media users, finding that satisfaction has either held steady or improved.\n\nThis comes at a time when major tech companies are heavily investing in AI to enhance their services.\n\nSearch Engine Satisfaction Holds Strong\n\nGoogle, Bing, and other search engines have rapidly integrated AI features into their platforms over the past year. While critics have raised concerns about potential negative impacts, the ACSI study suggests users are responding positively.\n\nGoogle maintains its position as the most satisfying search engine with an ACSI score of 81, up 1% from last year. Users particularly appreciate its AI-powered features.\n\nInterestingly, Bing and Yahoo! have seen notable improvements in user satisfaction, notching 3% gains to reach scores of 77 and 76, respectively. These are their highest ACSI scores in over a decade, likely due to their AI enhancements launched in 2023.\n\nThe study hints at the potential of new AI-enabled search functionality to drive further improvements in the customer experience. Bing has seen its market share improve by small but notable margins, rising from 6.35% in the first quarter of 2023 to 7.87% in Q1 2024.\n\nCustomer Experience Improvements\n\nThe ACSI study shows improvements across nearly all benchmarks of the customer experience for search engines. Notable areas of improvement include:\n\nEase of navigation\n\nEase of using the site on different devices\n\nLoading speed performance and reliability\n\nVariety of services and information\n\nFreshness of content\n\nThese improvements suggest that AI enhancements positively impact various aspects of the search experience.\n\nSocial Media Sees Modest Gains\n\nFor the third year in a row, user satisfaction with social media platforms is on the rise, increasing 1% to an ACSI score of 74.\n\nTikTok has emerged as the new industry leader among major sites, edging past YouTube with a score of 78. This underscores the platform’s effective use of AI-driven content recommendations.\n\nMeta’s Facebook and Instagram have also seen significant improvements in user satisfaction, showing 3-point gains. While Facebook remains near the bottom of the industry at 69, Instagram’s score of 76 puts it within striking distance of the leaders.\n\nChallenges Remain\n\nDespite improvements, the study highlights ongoing privacy and advertising challenges for search engines and social media platforms. Privacy ratings for search engines remain relatively low but steady at 79, while social media platforms score even lower at 73.\n\nAdvertising experiences emerge as a key differentiator between higher- and lower-satisfaction brands, particularly in social media. New ACSI benchmarks reveal user concerns about advertising content’s trustworthiness and personal relevance.\n\nWhy This Matters For SEO Professionals\n\nThis study provides an independent perspective on how users are responding to the AI push in online services. For SEO professionals, these findings suggest that:\n\nAI-enhanced search features resonate with users, potentially changing search behavior and expectations. The improving satisfaction with alternative search engines like Bing may lead to a more diverse search landscape. The continued importance of factors like content freshness and site performance in user satisfaction aligns with long-standing SEO best practices.\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into our online experiences, SEO strategies may need to adapt to changing user preferences.\n\nFeatured Image: kate3155/Shutterstock"

        "content": "Impactful SEO is rarely executed by a lone wolf.\n\nYou need resources. You need buy-in from higher-ups – a CMO, head of product, or even CEO.\n\nBut here’s the thing: those lengthy SEO documents outlining objectives, audiences, competitors, keywords, and that six-month Gantt chart vaguely detailing optimization projects – they’re not getting read.\n\nOn the contrary, it is a roadblock to you getting a green light for resources.\n\nAn executive can quickly scan one short email containing a clear request and sign off. However, they need to set aside dedicated time to read a strategy document in depth – and time is not something executives have a lot of.\n\nAnd even if they sign off today, the reality is business priorities shift. Competitive landscapes change. Algorithms are updated.\n\nSEO is executed in a constant state of flux. It demands flexibility on a monthly, even weekly basis.\n\nSo, let’s ditch the long documents and prioritize actions over proposals with agile SEO.\n\nWhy Agile SEO Strategies Work\n\nAgile SEO involves incremental iteration.\n\nBreak complex, overarching projects down into small, frequent changes.\n\nEnable continual progress.\n\nForget the pursuit of SEO perfection.\n\nThe key is to launch a minimum viable product (MVP) and monitor the impact on metrics.\n\nOnce you are armed with performance data, you can move on. The key performance indicator (KPI) impact will get you buy-in for the resources you need.\n\nLet me give you an example.\n\nSay your overarching goal is to completely overhaul the website architecture of an e-commerce site – all the URL routes, page titles, meta descriptions, and H1s for the homepage, category pages, and product pages.\n\nThe Old Way: One Giant Leap\n\nThe traditional approach involves pitching the entire SEO project at once. Your argument is that it’s good for SEO.\n\nThe site will rank higher and significantly impact the organic sessions. Which is true.\n\nHowever, the document communicating all the reasons and requirements is complicated to review.\n\nThe project will seem too large. It will likely not make it onto your development team’s roadmap, as they will likely feel your request will overload their development cycle.\n\nAgile SEO Approach: Small Iterations\n\nWhat if you broke it down into micro-wins?\n\nInstead of pitching the entire project, request approval for a small but impactful change.\n\nFor example, optimizing the title tag and meta description of the homepage.\n\nThe documentation for this will be less than one page. The change request is equivalent to snackable content. Because it’s easy to implement, it’s much easier to incorporate it into a development sprint.\n\nNow, say this quick change positively impacts KPIs, such as a 3% lift in homepage organic sessions. You can then argue for similar changes for the category pages, pointing out that if we get a similar KPI lift as we did for the homepage, this will achieve X more organic sessions.\n\nYou have already proven such tactics can increase KPIs. So, there is more trust in your approach. And it’s, again, a small request. So, your development team is more likely to do it.\n\nAnd you can rinse and repeat until you have the whole site migrated.\n\nHow To Document An Agile SEO Strategy\n\nSo now we know to stop writing long SEO strategy documents and instead start creating agile, “snackable” tactics.\n\nBut we still need to understand what:\n\nHas been completed in the past.\n\nIs being worked on now.\n\nIs coming up next.\n\nAll the ideas are.\n\nThis information must be easy to digest, centrally accessible, and flexible.\n\nOne solution for this is an “SEO calendar” document.\n\nElements of an SEO calendar:\n\nDate column: Ideally matched against IT sprint cycles. This does not mean every SEO initiative involves IT. But if you need a developer’s assistance, it will simplify cross-functional team projects. Having it set, for example, every two weeks also promotes small but constant releases from the SEO team.\n\nIdeally matched against IT sprint cycles.

Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nYou can use tables to keep it easy to scan.\n\nFor example, in the case of a title tag change, it could be as simple as a single table.\n\nThe key is to avoid long paragraphs of text.

        "content": "Bing is rolling out a new version of Generative Search that displays information in an intuitive way that encourages exploration but also prioritizes clicks from the search results to websites.\n\nMicrosoft introduced their new version of AI search:\n\n“After introducing LLM-powered chat answers on Bing in February of last year, we’ve been hard at work on the ongoing revolution of search. …Today, we’re excited to share an early view of our new generative search experience which is currently shipping to a small percentage of user queries.”\n\nNew Layout\n\nBing’s announcement discusses new features that not only make it easy for users to find information, Bing also makes it easy for users to see the organic search results and click through and browse websites.\n\nOn the desktop view, Bing shows three panels:\n\nA table of content on the left\n\nAI answers in the center (with links to website sources)\n\nTraditional organic search results on the right hand side\n\nEven more organic search results beneath “the fold”\n\nThe table of contents that is on the right hand side is invites exploration. It has the main topic at the top, with directly related subtopics beneath it. This is so much better than a People Also Asked type of navigation because it invites the user to explore and click on an organic search result to keep on exploring.\n\nScreenshot: Table Of Contents\n\nThis layout is the result of a conscious decision at Bing to engineer it so that that it preserves and encourages clicks to websites.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the new generative AI search experience. What’s notable is how Bing surrounds the AI answers with organic search results.\n\nScreenshot Of The New Bing AI Search Results\n\nBing makes a point to explain that they have tested the new interface to make sure that the search results will send the same amount of traffic and to avoid creating a layout that results in an increase in zero click search results.\n\nWhen other search engines talk about search quality it is always from the context of user satisfaction. Bing’s announcement makes it clear that sustaining traffic to websites was an important context that guided the design of the new layout.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a typical Bing AI search result for a query about the life span of elephants.\n\nNote that all the areas that I bounded with blue boxes are AI answers while everything outside of the blue boxes are organic search results.\n\nScreenshot Of Mix of AI And Organic Results\n\nThe screenshot makes it clear that there is a balance of organic search results and AI answers. In addition to those contextually relevant organic search results there are also search results on the right hand side (not shown in the above screenshot).\n\nMicrosoft’s blog post explained:\n\n“We are continuing to look closely at how generative search impacts traffic to publishers. Early data indicates that this experience maintains the number of clicks to websites and supports a healthy web ecosystem. The generative search experience is designed with this in mind, including retaining traditional search results and increasing the number of clickable links, like the references in the results.”\n\nBing’s layout is a huge departure from the zero-click style of layouts seen in other search engines.

        "content": "Bing is rolling out a new version of Generative Search that displays information in an intuitive way that encourages exploration but also prioritizes clicks from the search results to websites.\n\nMicrosoft introduced their new version of AI search:\n\n“After introducing LLM-powered chat answers on Bing in February of last year, we’ve been hard at work on the ongoing revolution of search. …Today, we’re excited to share an early view of our new generative search experience which is currently shipping to a small percentage of user queries.”\n\nNew Layout\n\nBing’s announcement discusses new features that not only make it easy for users to find information, Bing also makes it easy for users to see the organic search results and click through and browse websites.\n\nOn the desktop view, Bing shows three panels:\n\nA table of content on the left\n\nAI answers in the center (with links to website sources)\n\nTraditional organic search results on the right hand side\n\nEven more organic search results beneath “the fold”\n\nThe table of contents that is on the right hand side is invites exploration. It has the main topic at the top, with directly related subtopics beneath it. This is so much better than a People Also Asked type of navigation because it invites the user to explore and click on an organic search result to keep on exploring.\n\nScreenshot: Table Of Contents\n\nThis layout is the result of a conscious decision at Bing to engineer it so that that it preserves and encourages clicks to websites.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the new generative AI search experience. What’s notable is how Bing surrounds the AI answers with organic search results.\n\nScreenshot Of The New Bing AI Search Results\n\nBing makes a point to explain that they have tested the new interface to make sure that the search results will send the same amount of traffic and to avoid creating a layout that results in an increase in zero click search results.\n\nWhen other search engines talk about search quality it is always from the context of user satisfaction. Bing’s announcement makes it clear that sustaining traffic to websites was an important context that guided the design of the new layout.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a typical Bing AI search result for a query about the life span of elephants.\n\nNote that all the areas that I bounded with blue boxes are AI answers while everything outside of the blue boxes are organic search results.\n\nScreenshot Of Mix of AI And Organic Results\n\nThe screenshot makes it clear that there is a balance of organic search results and AI answers. In addition to those contextually relevant organic search results there are also search results on the right hand side (not shown in the above screenshot).\n\nMicrosoft’s blog post explained:\n\n“We are continuing to look closely at how generative search impacts traffic to publishers. Early data indicates that this experience maintains the number of clicks to websites and supports a healthy web ecosystem. The generative search experience is designed with this in mind, including retaining traditional search results and increasing the number of clickable links, like the references in the results.”\n\nBing’s layout is a huge departure from the zero-click style of layouts seen in other search engines. Bing has purposely designed their generative AI layout to maintain clicks to websites. It cannot be overstated how ethical Bing’s approach to the web ecosystem is.\n\nBing Encourages Browsing And Discovery\n\nAn interesting feature of Bing’s implementation of generative AI search is that it shows the answer to the initial question first, and it also anticipates related questions.

        "url": "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/moving-from-niche-sites-affiliate-to-agency-owner/508482/",
        "content": "This week’s Ask An SEO question comes from Mike in New York, who asks:\n\n“I have been creating affiliate blogs and niche websites throughout my 10 year career. Had some great successes and setbacks to share. But now I feel tired of it with Google also specifically targeting more of these types of websites in their updates. What other fields are there to explore in SEO, what else is working right now? How is client side SEO? How can a person like me who has worked on content websites throughout their career can make a switch? What does future hold for SEO? “\n\nGreat question, and one that actually led to me starting my agency. Here’s the background and then the answer to your question.\n\nI had niche sites in music, weddings, clothing, architecture, etc.\n\nThey were all growing and doing well, but I got bored of the same topics in the same niches, and it became incredibly disheartening when unqualified affiliate managers took over programs, destroying parts of my income, or companies closed their programs because of low-value affiliates being approved in.\n\nThat’s when a few interesting things happened:\n\nA few of the advertisers on my sites (affiliates and sponsors) asked how I was driving traffic, so I shared with them how I optimized for search and then social later on.\n\nNext, I walked them through the email funnels and automations I created. The email automation backfired on me big time when 3 of my sites got hacked through a plugin, and 20 spam newsletter blasts went out simultaneously as they posted spam blog posts to my sites). Never connect your newsletter to automatically drop when a new blog post goes live.\n\nI met with two of the companies in person.\n\nBoth companies asked me if I could do the optimizations I do for myself for them. It was interesting because I was getting bored and missed the structure of a “real job,” which sounds weird because I’m not a 9 to 5 person.\n\nAfter a few more conversations, it made sense. So I started letting my niche sites die and used them for training purposes as I brought on contractors and staff.\n\nNow, probably 10 or 15 years later, my agency is still going, and each of the domains has expired (I chose not to sell them even though I got an offer when they were bigger).\n\nNow onto the answer, there are four things to be aware of and prepare for.\n\nThe first is how agency work differs so you can mentally prepare.\n\nNext is lining up why you’re more qualified than an experienced agency.\n\nThird, you’ll want to outline the types of clients you can work on (can and want to are different) and projects you’re able to do.\n\nLast is being ready for more instability and inconsistency than being a niche site owner.\n\nBeing Mentally Ready For SEO Consulting\n\nWhen you leave building and monetizing your own websites for consulting, you leave as your own boss. You know what works and does not, and what needs to be included in content, for example.\n\nBut it is not your choice anymore, and that becomes frustrating.\n\nYou know that the Google Reviews update recommends listing multiple shopping options in order to provide a better user experience.\n\nStill, the ad sales team or affiliate manager sold a sponsored post. Their agreement prevents you from adding the extra store. Then, they want to know why the review or list isn’t ranking.\n\nAnother obstacle is when they insist the content cannot have “real experience” or list certain or any “negatives” because the content is a sponsored post – and everyone needs to make the advertiser happy.\n\nGoogle and social media guidelines do not matter in the ad and publisher affiliate manager world; it’s about the advertiser and getting more money from them. They are not SEO pros or social media specialists; they are sales and account managers.\n\nTheir job isn’t to know that their way of thinking and selling impacts the loss of traffic. They just need to close sales and negotiate higher commissions.\n\nWith ecommerce, you have to meet brand guidelines, which can include not being able to use direct and specific language.\n\nSometimes you cannot follow pixel lengths (character counts) for title tags because it goes “against brand,” and that same team will ask why the titles don’t show up in the search results.\n\nOther times, you have to “stick to branding” instead of meeting customer intent. This will drive you crazy because the opportunities are right there, but branding almost always wins, even when it costs the company money. This is a cycle that runs on repeat.\n\nAs a niche site owner, you focus on UX and revenue, but branding usually takes center stage with a company.\n\nThe branding team is not a performance marketing team. It is guided by the general counsel and going for what is required for the trademark and appearance of the brand.\n\nAs a consultant, you will benefit from learning about branding and finding a way to balance the two. Corporate branding is different from niche site branding.\n\nThe general counsel also comes into play. When you run a niche site, you can take original photos, give real feedback, and share genuine opinions.\n\nThe general counsel of your client may decide that this is not allowed on an ecommerce store, service company, or within the publication.\n\nA story could be about to break, and you have an opportunity to get massive backlinks and Google Discover traffic or beat the current articles ranking because none of them have original thoughts or experiences.\n\nBut the general counsel holds it up for review, and the opportunity passes you by. Or the counsel decides with branding that listing negatives is bad for the company or company image, even though it can build consumer confidence through transparency.\n\nThe lack of trust builders can negatively impact both SEO and conversion rates. It isn’t their job to know how to rank a website or convert a consumer – that is your job. You also need to work within the atmosphere they provide, as you are not part of the company.\n\nYou are no longer the boss, even though you own your agency. It is your client’s website and platform. You are an easy-to-fire version of an employee who relies on the decision-maker trusting your advice.\n\nThat means you cannot push back as heavily as an actual employee; you have to make more sacrifices while keeping things afloat.\n\nThat does not mean being dishonest or not sharing the downsides, but you do walk a fine line in every meeting.\n\nIt is frustrating not to be the boss or able to make the decisions, so prepare yourself mentally for the above and more. With that said, you will learn how to better select clients and who you work with as you establish yourself. My current client base is like living a dream.\n\nIt took me over a decade to learn how to detect red flags and when it is time to move on, but now that I did, I love working with all of them.\n\nIt is the same enjoyment I got from running my own sites, but I get the structure and deadlines I missed from the corporate world. Many of them have become friends of mine outside of work. Even when I part ways with them, many keep in touch, as we did become actual friends.\n\nList Your Skills\n\nYes, literally create a list of what you are highly qualified to do and print it out. This comes in handy when pitching clients, and imposter syndrome kicks in. And it will!\n\nUnder each skill, list a few successes with each so you can mention it when talking to clients. Make sure you change them out as new ones happen.\n\nSomething you did five years ago is no longer relevant as an agency. You need new and consistent wins to stay in business.\n\nSkills can include:\n\nEmail and SMS acquisition.\n\nMonetization (CPC, CPM, CPL, CPV, download, sponsorships, affiliate, subscriptions, info products, etc…).\n\nSEO.\n\nNiche knowledge and the levels about which parts of the niche.\n\nConnections with other niche influencers and experts.\n\nAudience building (social media, readership, community forming, events planning, etc…).\n\nCRO or conversion rate optimization.\n\nCode and markup (HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, schema, python, etc…).\n\nDatafeed optimization.\n\nSyndication.\n\nPR, interviews, and media training.\n\nOnce your list is built, rate each skill on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the highest. Think about which skills help other skills or teams so you can become a go-to resource for clients.\n\nNow invest in yourself to get each marketable skill to at least a seven. I did this through necessity, like learning CSS (which I’m still not very good at) because I had to.\n\nI also went to conferences where I could learn and discovered that many “gurus” and “keynotes” are not actual experts.\n\nA few shows that changed my trajectory learning-wise are Pubcon, State of Search in Dallas, Zenith Duluth, and Barbados SEO. These, in particular, really changed how I see things. But I don’t use them to build business.\n\nAs an agency owner with niche experience, if you want to build clients, you go where the hiring managers are. If you are in the electronics space, go to electronics shows and inventors shows and pitch to speak.\n\nThat is where the marketers and founders are listening and looking for help. Do you work in housewares, food and recipes, etc.? The home shows are your perfect market to build clients.\n\nThe Types Of Clients You Can Work On And Projects You Can Do\n\nEcommerce SEO is very different from niche sites – the same with publishers and service-based companies. Then you get into non-profits, which is an entirely different ballgame.\n\nDecide if you want to work on competing companies or all complementary to each other.\n\nNow, determine how much time and effort each will take, and price yourself accordingly.\n\nDon’t be afraid to map out hours on your calendar. This helps me keep track of what I need to be doing, in addition to my to-do list (which I literally write out and check off each week).\n\nNews sites (wholesale, trade, organization, media).\n\nNiche sites (publishers, bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, influencers, etc…).\n\nEcommerce.\n\nService providers.\n\nLead gen.\n\nSEO audits.\n\nRetainer projects.\n\nAdvisor roles.\n\nHourly.\n\nWorkshops.\n\nPublic speaking.\n\nEvent hosting.\n\nPrepare For Instability\n\nIf you think Google updates or having a social media account closed is bad, wait until all clients leave in the same week. Things spiral faster than niche sites tanking.\n\nIt happens to almost everyone.\n\nClients are going to get pitched all the time, and you will lose some, even though you did nothing wrong.\n\nOr you grow a company and brand, they make money and hire a new VP or Director, and that person brings in a new agency because they worked with them in the past.\n\nYou’ll also hear that the new agency can scale and work with larger companies. This may not be true, but it is what the founders hear from other founders when they attend networking events.\n\nYou lose when their peers put ideas in their heads.\n\nAlways put a little bit of money away, even $100 a month. It adds up and lets you keep going when things get bad.\n\nThis post is getting long; if you can’t tell, I’m passionate about it. So I’ll stop here. Give it a try if you have the ability and can take the risk both financially and mentally.\n\nThe worst that will happen is you fail and go back to building niche sites, take a full-time job, or do a hybrid. At least you won’t ever have to wonder what could have been.\n\nMore resources:\n\nFeatured Image: ESB Basic/Shutterstock"

        "url": "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/study-backs-googles-claims-ai-search-boosts-user-satisfaction/523059/",
        "content": "A new study finds that despite concerns about AI in online services, users are more satisfied with search engines and social media platforms than before.\n\nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) conducted its annual survey of search and social media users, finding that satisfaction has either held steady or improved.\n\nThis comes at a time when major tech companies are heavily investing in AI to enhance their services.\n\nSearch Engine Satisfaction Holds Strong\n\nGoogle, Bing, and other search engines have rapidly integrated AI features into their platforms over the past year. While critics have raised concerns about potential negative impacts, the ACSI study suggests users are responding positively.\n\nGoogle maintains its position as the most satisfying search engine with an ACSI score of 81, up 1% from last year. Users particularly appreciate its AI-powered features.\n\nInterestingly, Bing and Yahoo! have seen notable improvements in user satisfaction, notching 3% gains to reach scores of 77 and 76, respectively. These are their highest ACSI scores in over a decade, likely due to their AI enhancements launched in 2023.\n\nThe study hints at the potential of new AI-enabled search functionality to drive further improvements in the customer experience. Bing has seen its market share improve by small but notable margins, rising from 6.35% in the first quarter of 2023 to 7.87% in Q1 2024.\n\nCustomer Experience Improvements\n\nThe ACSI study shows improvements across nearly all benchmarks of the customer experience for search engines. Notable areas of improvement include:\n\nEase of navigation\n\nEase of using the site on different devices\n\nLoading speed performance and reliability\n\nVariety of services and information\n\nFreshness of content\n\nThese improvements suggest that AI enhancements positively impact various aspects of the search experience.\n\nSocial Media Sees Modest Gains\n\nFor the third year in a row, user satisfaction with social media platforms is on the rise, increasing 1% to an ACSI score of 74.\n\nTikTok has emerged as the new industry leader among major sites, edging past YouTube with a score of 78. This underscores the platform’s effective use of AI-driven content recommendations.\n\nMeta’s Facebook and Instagram have also seen significant improvements in user satisfaction, showing 3-point gains. While Facebook remains near the bottom of the industry at 69, Instagram’s score of 76 puts it within striking distance of the leaders.\n\nChallenges Remain\n\nDespite improvements, the study highlights ongoing privacy and advertising challenges for search engines and social media platforms. Privacy ratings for search engines remain relatively low but steady at 79, while social media platforms score even lower at 73.\n\nAdvertising experiences emerge as a key differentiator between higher- and lower-satisfaction brands, particularly in social media. New ACSI benchmarks reveal user concerns about advertising content’s trustworthiness and personal relevance.\n\nWhy This Matters For SEO Professionals\n\nThis study provides an independent perspective on how users are responding to the AI push in online services. For SEO professionals, these findings suggest that:\n\nAI-enhanced search features resonate with users, potentially changing search behavior and expectations. The improving satisfaction with alternative search engines like Bing may lead to a more diverse search landscape. The continued importance of factors like content freshness and site performance in user satisfaction aligns with long-standing SEO best practices.\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into our online experiences, SEO strategies may need to adapt to changing user preferences.\n\nFeatured Image: kate3155/Shutterstock"
